# HighLow

## Game Implementation

- It is a multiplayer game.
- Once the game is deployed we see a open card with some value.
- Players can register to the game by betting their commitments High/Low.
- With an interval of every 30 sec the new cards are released.
- After the next card is revealed, all the players who bet their commitment for previous card reveal their commitments.
- Players with right bet recieve money.
